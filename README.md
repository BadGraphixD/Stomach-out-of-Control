# Stomach out of Control
This is a game created with Unity for the 2020 GMTK Game Jam. It's a platformer and you play an alien on a spaceship, who needs to reach the toiled in time. I've created this game in under 48 hours, creating the code and art completely from scratch. The sound effects are not my own.
